**Step 1**
Open the directory that the shell script is in in your terminal. (You can do this by opening it in file explorer, right clicking, and selecting 'Open in terminal')

**Step 2**
Run this command: `chmod +x [filename]`. e.g. `chmod +x script.sh`. This gives the file permission to run.

**Step 3**
Run the script by typing the file name, for example `./script.sh`. You may be prompted for your password, in which case just type it in (obviously).
